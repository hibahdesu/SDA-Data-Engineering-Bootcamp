    "## Steps we take to scrap the data from the website:\n",
    "- First, we visited the website and explored its structure to understand where the desired data is located.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since the website was dynamic and required interaction, we initially attempted to use a tool called Selenium. We programmed Selenium to navigate through the pages, click on watches, and access their details. However, we encountered difficulties with extracting all the necessary information, particularly with the technical data section. The website utilized JavaScript scrolling to display additional details, which Selenium couldn't handle effectively within our limited timeframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To overcome this challenge, we opted for an alternative approach using BeautifulSoup. With BeautifulSoup, we scraped the required data in a more straightforward manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We began by scraping the links, titles, and image sources of each watch from the initial page. We stored this information in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Next, we implemented a loop to visit each watch's individual page by following the links in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each watch's page contained additional watches, so we used NavigableString to search through the XML/HTML structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We implemented another loop to extract the image sources, links, and titles of the watches on the secondary page and added them to the existing lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We further iterated through each watch's link and accessed the page containing the technical details.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this step, we retrieved the title and description of each watch and then extracted the technical details from the table. We parsed the rows and columns of the table and stored the information in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We encountered another challenge when some watches had different color variations with distinct details. To address this, we revisited the HTML of the page to identify additional color variations, extract their links, and add them to the list of links.\n",
    "\n",
    "- By looping through these links, we were able to scrape the details of each color variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For some columns, we couldn't find the corresponding details on the website. In these cases, we marked those columns as null since the watches themselves didn't provide that information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- After collecting all the necessary details, we organized the data into a dataframe and saved it as a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We then read the data from the CSV file and examined its structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dataset consisted of 131 rows, numbered from 0 to 130, and contained 40 columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As we explored the data, we noticed that certain columns had missing values. These missing values indicate that the corresponding watches did not have those specific details available.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To investigate further, we analyzed the watches with missing values and discovered that those specific watches did not provide the information for those columns.\n"
