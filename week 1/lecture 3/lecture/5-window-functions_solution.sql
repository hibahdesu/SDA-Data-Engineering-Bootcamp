  Window Function Introduction
*****************************************/

/*
The keyword `OVER` signals that this is a `window function`, as opposed to a `grouped aggregate function`.

- The empty parentheses after `OVER` is a window specification.
- In this simple example it is empty `()` this means default to aggregating the window function over all rows in the result sets.
